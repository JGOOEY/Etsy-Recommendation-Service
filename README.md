# Etsy Recommendation Systems 
### Collaborative Engineering with Etsy Staff SWE / Scientists

## Objective
Create a prototype service that recommends items from Etsy that samples from a distribution that is stored in the cloud.

## Background
Current machine learning algorithms for information retrieval are based on machine learning that prioritize whether or not returned recommendations are relevant to a particular user’s history. While this is useful for buyer’s that are almost ready to purchase and check out, it becomes problematic for the buyers that are window shopping and exploring the site for things like gifts and impulse buys. For this reason, instead of prioritizing relevance (how interested you are based on your past purchases), Etsy is interested in building infrastructure to effect real-time buyer exploration and exploitation of our listings on the site.

## Project Goals 
Accessed Etsy website for listings, which you can group according to Search queries. With this data, the main goal is to create a recommendations server, which can read and write data (i.e., to/from a Redis cluster, on GCP or your own machine).
